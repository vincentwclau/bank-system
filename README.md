## Code Test & Rule
- Test duration: 80 minutes, consist of:
  - 5 minutes preparation
  - 60 minutes coding
  - 15 minutes explaination after the coding
- Record the test process by Zoom 
- During the recording, share the whole screen and record your sound.
- If you can pass all test cases, it does means "complete".
- If you can complete all test cases before 50 minutes, you can start with the explaination section earlier in the video.
- If you cannot complete the coding within 60 minutes, you still need to start the explaination part.
- The explaination part should be in either Cantonese, Mandarin or English.
- One single video for all parts (preparation + coding + explaination), at most 80 minutes.
- Every single character of code should be hand-made. No copy & paste.
- Try the zoom recording function (screen+sound) before the real test.

## The recording video should include the followings steps.
- Create your own github repo, make it public. 
- Download the question from this repo
  - https://github.com/vincentwclau/bank-system
- All the coding process should be recorded.
- Push the code to your repo.
- The Explaination should conclude:
  - Do you know purspose of the test? 
  - What are the skills should the Java developer acquire before the test?
  - What difficulties did you encounter during the test?
  - What things should the tester aware during the test?

## Test Deliverables
- Your Github repo.
- The zoom recording.
